    <h1>Growth Mindset Survey </h1>
    <p>
        Have you ever wondered whether you have a growth mindset? We have put together a fun, simple survey
        to help you determine your current mindset.The goal of this survey is to measure your beliefs about the
        malleability of intelligence, the relative importance of learning and perfect performance, and your attitudes
        toward effort and mistakes. At the end of the survey, we have also included some helpful resources for
        cultivating a growth mindset. Our survey, created for adults and teens, consists of 15 questions.
